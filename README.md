# Chemistry Fox
A discord bot with some basic chemistry functions, such as calculations and searching compounds, and mathematics.
 
## Commands
 
### Help
`Help`- Opens the help menu for commands, their description and their formatting.

### Bot Information

`Botinfo` - Returns a list of the bot's information

`Invite` - To invite me

`Vote` - Vote to support me!

`Latency` - Returns the bot's latency

`Bugreport <report>` - In case something is broken

`Suggestion <suggestion>` - To suggest new features!

`Changelog` - List of new updates and notices

### Chemistry 

`Mol <formula> <number>` - Calculate grams or moles by inputting the compound and a number, then selecting the units inputted

`Molarmass <formula>` - Calculates the molar mass of the compound

`Element <symbol>` - Gets the element's basic information

`Constants` - List of common constants

`Balance <reaction>`- Balances the reaction. Must be in the form: `aA + bB -> cC + dD`. It can have more than 2 reactants/products

### PubChem

`Search <compound>` - Returns a list of the first 10 compounds found using the input with basic information and a button linked to the search. Can use the CID for the command 

`Info` for more information

`Info <CID>` - Returns a list of information found in PubChem, along with a button linked to the compound's page.

### Mathematics

`Quadratic <a> <b> <c>` - Solves for axÂ² + bx + c = 0

`Average <value 1>, <value 2>, ...` - Returns the average and standard deviation of all the inputs. Inputs must be separated by a comma.


I'm open to adding more features, commands, and subjects like physics and biology! Also considering adding multi-language support.
